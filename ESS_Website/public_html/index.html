            <p>
                We understand that cost can be prohibitive for schools having solutions that they need. We also
                don't want that to be the case for you. Many school solutions claim to be free, but they are only
                free for basic features. An account with Elemental School Solutions provides ALL of the features
                necessary for a LOW cost.

                Many school management systems feel like the developers are disconnected from the needs of a
                school. Elemental School Solutions has been designed with teachers and school administrators in
                mind. Elemental School Solutions has been designed and developed by a teacher passionate about
                technology and teaching with the help of other passionate teachers and school administrators.
